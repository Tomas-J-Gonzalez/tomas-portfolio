      <p class="Callout"><b>Design-ism:</b> A word or phrase designers use that most people don’t understand.</p>

    
    <h2 id="confusion">What is design?&nbsp;<a class="heading-anchor" href="#confusion" aria-label="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
      <p>It's understood that design is primarily for solving problems and this is one of the main points that differentiates design from art. Whereas art is to be interpreted differently and has, in my opinion, a more emotional/personal intrinsic quality, design differs in the fact that it has (in most cases), a purpose to communicate or motivate the viewer/user in a specific manner.</p>

    <h2 id="confusion">Functionality&nbsp;<a class="heading-anchor" href="#confusion" aria-label="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
        <p> There is a clear understanding of the functionality of design and therefore it is a widely held fact that design is problem-solving at it's core. Needless to say, identifying problems is also a characteristic of design. Because before you solve a problem you first have to identify one. Yet designers tend jump ahead and skip defining the problem and to get straight into the visceral stage of the design process.
        They don't ask the right questions OR don't know what questions to ask. Upon finishing a design, they don’t know ‘WHAT’ the purpose OR perhaps even ‘WHY’ they chose to design what they did. The end goal was not questioned, a problem was not defined or prioritised, and neither were possible solutions framed up. No systemised way to approach the design problem was set.
        Yet the design process and the decisions made along the way go much further than identifying a problem and solving it. 

        <p>This excerpt states it clearly:</p>
          <blockquote> <p> “Once we release a solution, it will become part of a larger system. Although we can determine specific functionalities for that solution and define a target user group, we cannot predict and control who will use our solution and how it will be used.” <cite>— (“Inclusive Design Guides", 2018)</cite>  </blockquote></p>
            <p> When we design, we are doing so in a changing world, we have to be aware of our design decisions and the possible impacts. We are also designing for specific goals but we need to keep in mind that the goal can change, and in most cases either through iteration or due to undefined problems the goal will change. </p>

        <p>Every small design choice is part of a bigger intricate system. Be sure that it will have an effect in some way or another. Thus reinforcing why a designer should not carelessly jump into the visceral design process without prior research. Try to not to hop on your design software and change a certain color of a primary button because you feel like it or because a significant other did not appreciate that specific shade, hue or tint of purple. </p>

        <p>Design choices backed up by definitive purpose, understanding and research are paramount. We need to first understand our design decisions, especially the ones we typically regard as minor. We need to explain to ourselves ‘WHY’ we made them, you should be able to do this clearly and distinctly (simply looking pretty isn’t good enough, there’s more to it). </p>

        <p>Articulating your design choices is a hard task, Paul Rand knew this:</p>

       <blockquote> <p>“How to present a new idea is, perhaps, one of the designer’s most difficult tasks”. <cite>– Paul Rand, American Art Director (1914-1996). </cite> </blockquote>  </p>

       <p>After we understand our design decisions we can begin to understand potential effects within a bigger system; "How will my design effect so and so". Of course this depends on the context, scale and area of the design. There is great value of this holistic approach to design. Everything is connected in some way, therefore we need to take into account for every choice/interaction, as Henry Dreyfuss writes:</p> 

       <blockquote><p>“When the points of contact between the product and the people become a point of friction, then the designer has failed”. <cite>— 1955: Dreyfuss' Designing for People</cite></p></blockquote>

       <h2 id="confusion">Conclusion&nbsp;<a class="heading-anchor" href="#confusion" aria-label="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
       <p>We don’t need the cognitive capacity or IQ of a genius to identify the points of friction or to understand the significance of the interconnectedness of systems/people and how it relates to design. Whether you're working on a small scale or a  large design project, take a step back - look at the bigger picture and think about how your design fits into the frame.</p> 

        <p>To design is to think, in order to fully adopt this holistic approach we need to be able to broaden our perception to the world around us. To see how our designs are connected and how they will effect upon contact with people or systems and evolve together (take in consideration long-term & short-term). </p> 

      <blockquote><p>“Holistic design takes into account the person, the device, the moment, the ethnographic environment, the physical space as well as human behavior and psychology, i.e. thinking, attitudes, emotions, motivations, abilities, triggers etc., and aims to deliver an optimal experience. At times the entire experience (with a product or brand) is not limited to digital devices but is a mix of digital, real-world brick-and-mortar, and human-to-human interactions.” <cite>— Miklos Philips, Principal UX Designer at Toptal</cite></p></blockquote>
