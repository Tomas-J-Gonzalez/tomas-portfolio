    <p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL998ajnjN4">album</a> in question. There's also a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Empty_Bliss_Beyond_This_World">Wikipedia</a> about this music project.</p>
    <p>'The record is based on a study regarding people with Alzheimer's disease being able to remember music they listened to when they were younger, as well as where they were and how they felt listening to it. The album samples pre-World War II ballroom records Kirby bought in Brooklyn in December 2010.'</p>
    
    <h2 id="concept">Concept&nbsp;<a class="heading-anchor" href="#concept" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>  </h2>
    <p>An Empty Bliss Beyond This World attempts to reflect the mind of an Alzheimer's patient that struggles to remember key fragments of their own life. </p>
    <p>The record was based on a 2010 study about the ability of people with the disease to remember music from their time, as well as their context within the patient's life.</p>
    <p>The Caretaker project was inspired by the ballroom music in films such as Carnival of Souls (1962), The Shining (1980), and the television series Pennies from Heaven (1978), which drew Kirby to themes of memory loss:</p>
    <blockquote><p>"Famously, people as they got older have started seeing dead people, people from the past, and that's their reality because the brain's misfiring. I'm very interested in these kinds of stories. Music's probably the last thing to go for a lot of people with advanced Alzheimer's."</p></blockquote>
    <p>Never before have I witnessed music that so accurately depicts a mental disease as well as <b>An Empty Bliss Beyond This World</b>. Around 5 years ago I discovered the album by falling down the YouTube rabbit hole. For the next year or so I would listen to the album to help me sleep. It was a calming yet frightening experience. At the point in time I had no idea of the depth behind this musical project.</p>
    
    
    <h2 id="everywhere-at-the-end-of-time">Everywhere at the End of Time&nbsp;<a class="heading-anchor" href="#everywhere-at-the-end-of-time" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>  </h2>
      <p>It was 2 years later that I came to realise the concept that drove this ambient musical project. I then discovered the following album Everywhere at the End of Time by The Caretaker AKA English musician <a target="_blank" href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/1550794-Leyland-Kirby">Leyland Kirby</a>, the eleventh and final album under the alias 'The Caretaker'.</p>
      <p>It is 6 hour long album that is a musical representation of dementia/amnesia. </p>
      <p>The album is comprised of 6 stages. Stages have all been artistic reflections of specific symptoms which can be common with the progression and advancement of the different forms of Alzheimer's. Each stage has its own artwork associated with it.</p>

      <h3>Phase 1:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Here we experience the first signs of memory loss.</li>
      <li>This stage is most like a beautiful daydream.</li>
      <li>The glory of old age and recollection.</li>
      <li>The last of the great days.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Phase 2:</h3>
      <p>The second stage is the self realisation and awareness that something is wrong with a refusal to accept that. More effort is made to remember so memories can be more long form with a little more deterioration in quality. The overall personal mood is generally lower than the first stage and at a point before confusion starts setting in.</p>

      <h3>Phase 3:</h3>
      <p>Here we are presented with some of the last coherent memories before confusion fully rolls in and the grey mists form and fade away. Finest moments have been remembered, the musical flow in places is more confused and tangled. As we progress some singular memories become more disturbed, isolated, broken and distant. These are the last embers of awareness before we enter the post awareness stages.</p>

      <h3>Phase 4:</h3>
      <p>Post-Awareness Stage 4 is where serenity and the ability to recall singular memories gives way to confusions and horror. It's the beginning of an eventual process where all memories begin to become more fluid through entanglements, repetition and rupture.</p>

      <h3>Phase 5:</h3>
      <p>Post-Awareness Stage 5 confusions and horror. More extreme entanglements, repetition and rupture can give way to calmer moments. The unfamiliar may sound and feel familiar. Time is often spent only in the moment leading to isolation.</p>

      <h3>Phase 6:</h3>
      <p>Post-Awareness Stage 6 is without description.</p>
